# StoreUs - Assesment Project

## Description

This project is a simple e-commerce application that displays a list of products and allows the user to add them to a shopping cart. The user can also view the shopping cart and remove items from it. The application is built using React.js. The application is responsive and works on mobile devices as well.

## Installation

_Make sure you have Node.js installed on your machine version 16 or higher (18 is recommended)._

2. Run `npm install` or `yarn install` or `pnpm install` to install the dependencies.
3. To run the json server, you have two options:

   2. Run `npm run start:server:delay` or `yarn start:server:delay` or `pnpm start:server:delay` to start the json server on port 3001 in delay mode (to simulate a real API).
